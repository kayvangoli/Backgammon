# Backgammon

This is a Kotlin implementation of the game Backgammon for Android. The game logic is implemented using the TDD approach and JUnit is used for unit testing.

I created this project in 2019 and all technologies and libraries go back to that time. However, you can use Jetpack Compose for the UI and even set up your UI for a desktop application. I would be happy to hear your feedback on this project.

Some of the concepts and libraries that I used in this project are:

- Dagger2
- EventBus
- Robolectric
- Mockito Inline for Kotlin
- Strategy design pattern
- Memento design pattern (incomplete)

## Usage

To use the game, simply run the JUnit tests. The tests will exercise the game logic and verify that it is working correctly.
